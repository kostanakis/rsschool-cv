### Who am I:

I am seeker of new challenges, questions and problems to be solved, and tools to achieve those goals. So, from my school times I tried to learn Delphi, but it was too boring. Also in school I got into Linux, and liked it. When I graduated from university, I got my first work at IT not related to coding, but there was some things I wanted to improve for myself. So first thing I wrote in JS + Vue was parser for our oldschool HTML with a lot of data, which filtered data from there and provided table with alerts and some relevant info. Alas, that code hasn't survived through years. And that moment changed my life, I started to code more. Some more parsers written for money, that time in PHP, some work intranet portals, and utilitary Powershell scripting.

### What I want: 

Now I want to expand my skills by systematic learning of currently trending technologies in order to become more valuable specialist and to be able to create more good stuff.
